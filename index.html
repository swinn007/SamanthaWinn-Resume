        <p class="lead mb-4">	Not even my birth was unaffected by unusual circumstances. My name, my parents werenâ€™t the ones who had chosen it. The â€˜Samanthaâ€™ comes from the doctor who helped my mother give birth. I had only met him a few times after that, and I never seemed to have asked why you named me that. Was it the first thing that came to mind? Or did you already know what you were going to say? Perhaps this unusual way of naming made me who I am, as my life is just as unique. I had lived my whole life in West Covina but didnâ€™t call that city home. I didnâ€™t attend school there; instead, I was granted permission to attend school in San Gabriel. Going to school was a pain when I was younger and still was as I got older. I resented my parents for a short time as I didnâ€™t understand why I couldnâ€™t go to school in Covina or just move to San Gabriel since it seemed we were there all the time anyway. It only took me till high school that I realized they couldnâ€™t afford to move and made me go there since they wanted good schooling for me and my brother. 
<br><br>

        My parents also went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable and had a good childhood. They had multiple jobs when I was younger. While my father worked in the hospital, my mother jumped from job to job. My parents had a side hustle of housing people and driving them around Los Angeles. I grew accustomed to random people living in the guest room for months and my parents being the ones to take care of them and exposing me to different people and their goals in life. <br><br>

        Many aimed to get their student visas and study in the States. After seeing this repeatedly, I modeled myself to that type of drive. I hoped that college would fulfill a pleasure that would satisfy me for what I had done up to that point. I can see how other things may also lead to this feeling, but I had mainly viewed college as a way to gain happiness and opportunities. After fulfilling the want to go to college, I want to help my parent give me the comfortable life they provided. Continuing higher education and being able to help them in old age.
